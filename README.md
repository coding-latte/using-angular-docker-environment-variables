## How to pass OS Environment Variables to an Angular App

This is demo, to show you how you can pass configuration through Docker OS Environment Variables to your angular application during build.

To run this demo,

1. First, clone this repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/coding-latte/using-angular-docker-environment-variables.git`

2. And then, build the docker image:
   `docker build --rm -f "dockerfile" -t angular-docker-environment-variables:latest .`

3. And finally run the image you just built:
   `docker build --rm -f "dockerfile" -t angular-docker-environment-variables:latest .`

A follow up post will be posted soon.
